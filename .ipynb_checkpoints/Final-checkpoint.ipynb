    "## Intro\n",
    "In this project, we gathered information about Pittsburgh neighborhoods to see which neighborhood would be the most ideal for a robber (criminal) to live in. Our approach was to get the amount of arrests in Pittsburgh neighborhoods, the amount of firearm seizures in the Pittsburgh neighborhoods, and then the Pittsburgh nighborhood with the most supermarkets to rob from. The neighborhhod with the least firearm seizures, the least arrests, and the most supermarkets is the best neighborhood. We came up with these data sets by looking at the different datasets that had data about criminal activity. "
